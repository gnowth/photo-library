Note: this has only been tested with the latest chrome browser.

## Version requirement
- node: 19.7.0
- npm: 9.5.0

## Setup
- to run project in dev mode: `npm run dev`
- to run storybook: `npm run storybook`
- to run storybook test: `npm run check:storybook`

# Improvement
- match color palette properly
- match sizing of fonts/space properly
- improve responsiveness of the page. While there is some degree of responsiveness, it is not the best one
- only a sample story has been provided, to add one for each component
- only a sample unit/e2e test has been provided, to add for use cases
- use css that are compatible with more browsers
- create a default wrapper with redux for stories instead of creating a store in the story file
